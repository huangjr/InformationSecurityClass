## ECB
all of the blocks encrypted with the same key, think there could be some parallel mechanism to do this in order to get higher performance.
## CBC
the cipherText of the previous block cipher become the next block's key.
## DIY
I aims to invent an protocol that can quickly generate cipherText with parallel execution. Maybe generate the key once and use for all the data in the recent time.
